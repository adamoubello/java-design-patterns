# Composite pattern

Composite pattern prototype

## Description

The Composite Pattern allows you to compose objects into tree structures to represent partwhole hierarchies. Composite lets clients to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. Using a composite structure, we can apply the same operations over both composites and individual objects. In other words, in most cases we can ignore the differences between compositions of objects and individual objects.

## Use

Use the Composite Pattern, when:

â€¢ When you want to represent part-whole hierarchies of objects.

â€¢ When you want clients to be able to ignore the difference between compositions of objects and individual objects. Clients will treat all objects in the composite structure uniformly.
